# Computer Vision RPS
This project is regarding machine learning. Playing a game called Rock Paper and Scissor. Giving visual command to computer as a input.
## Milestone 2
- In milestone 2, creates a model using Teachable-Machine. 
- Teachable-Machine is web based tool which creates machine model easily. It is accessible to anyone.
- creats four classes Rock, Paper, Scissor and Nothing. Stores as many as images in each classes using identify the hand movement.
- Stores various imgages for rock, paper, scissor and nothing. It helps to identify any position for above classes.
- After this train the machine( get use to with each images and falls in which class.)
- Finishes with export the model. 
- In this export model opens a new window where Tensorflow creates kernel_model.h5 and label.txt file. Which is nothing but python code for machine to undderstand the image.
